Zero Crossing:

	Good for any really basic waveforms (Square, Saw, ect.) 
	Wave can be complicated as long it stays under the "Zero Line"

		Ex. NES Chiptune (No DCPM)

Peak Speed:

	Default. Slow but stable for all waveforms.
	All around good trigger. If you don't know which
	trigger to use, use this one.
		
		Ex. Mega Drive Chiptune


Positive Length:

	Sum up the positive length every zero-cross, and pick the biggest value.
	Good if a wave is complicated underneath the "Zero Line".

		Ex. Low Pass Filtered Saw

Negative Length:

	Sum up the negative length every zero-cross, and pick the biggest value.
	Good if a wave is complicated over the "Zero Line"

		Ex. Inverted Low Pass Filtered Saw

Crossing Length:

	A combination of Positive Length and Negative Length.
	Sum up the length every zero-cross, and pick the biggest value.
	Use it if there is a very special wave that Positive Length or 
	Negative Length can't handle.

		Ex. 

Max Rectified Area:

	Sum up the absolute amplification value every zero-cross, and pick the biggest value.
	Good for "sync" waves, Amplitude Modulation, and Ring Modulation

		Ex. Comlicated C64 Chiptune

Auto Trigger:

	Seek for highest and lowest value, calculate the average, and set it as trigger value.
	Good if the wave is simple, and has DC offset. (Currently the only 
	trigger that triggers on a wave doesn't cross the "Zero Line").

		Ex. VOSIM

None:

	If a wave perfectly matches the frame rate, it is the 
	best trigger out of all of them.

		Ex. A finely tuned Modular Synth
